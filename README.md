The official repository of the OpenTrench3D dataset.
Identifying and classifying underground utilities is a task of growing importance for efficient and effective urban planning and infrastructure maintenance. 
We present OpenTrench3D, a novel and comprehensive 3D Semantic Segmentation point cloud dataset designed for advancing the research and development in the urban underground utilities domain. 

# Dataset:
OpenTrench3D comprises photogrammetrically derived 3D point clouds capturing detailed scenes of open trenches, revealing underground utilities.

## Overview:
The dataset consists of 310 point clouds collected across 7 distinct areas, which include 5 water utility areas collected in Copenhagen, Denmark and 2 district heating utility areas, collected in Kalundborg, Denmark.
